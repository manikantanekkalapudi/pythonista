Special methods or Magic methods or Dunder Methods:
    Dunder methods let you emulate the behavior of built-in types. 
    For example, to get the length of a string you can call len('string').
    But an empty class definition doesnâ€™t support this behavior out of the box.
    We need to define the functionality.
