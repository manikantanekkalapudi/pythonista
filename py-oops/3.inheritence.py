Inheritence in Python

Inheritance is an important aspect of the object-oriented paradigm. Inheritance provides code reusability to the program because we can use an existing class to create a new class instead of creating it from scratch.
In inheritance, the child class acquires the properties and can access all the data members and functions defined in the parent class. A child class can also provide its specific implementation to the functions of the parent class.

    '''Source: https://www.journaldev.com/18722/python-static-method
    Static method -> Static methods in Python are extremely similar to python class level methods, the difference being that a static method is bound to a class rather than the objects for that class.
    This means that a static method can be called without an object for that class. This also means that static methods cannot modify the state of an object as they are not bound to it. Letâ€™s see how we can create static methods in Python.
    
    Static method -> It has a logical connection to the class but doesn't depend on any specific instance of the class or class variable'''
